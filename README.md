# Intelligent Document Processing(IDP) with Generative AI models

## Set up instructions for people helping test the notebooks

1. Create a SageMaker domain if you donâ€™t already have one

2. Create a user profile -> Make sure you add Comprehend (detect_pii_entities) + Textract (detect_document_text) policies to the IAM role

3. Launch a SageMaker Studio session + upload the folder

4. Use default settings when opening the notebook. 

5. Keep the MODEL_CONFIG cell as default, Isengard default account limits will prevent you from launching the other two instance types



## Lab1

This lab introduces the concept of Large Language Models (LLMs) and demonstrates how you can deploy one in SageMaker JumpStart. We discuss different types of models, look at the instances required to deploy them, and go through a few common use cases.

## Lab2

We often see privacy and PII redaction come up in IDP conversations. It is critical to protect common PII such as names, phone numbers, and dates of birth during document processing. In this notebook, we will use Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend alongside our LLM to make our IDP workflow more secure.

## Note

Compute Instances

- Due to [Event Engine limitation](https://catalog.workshops.aws/docs/en-US/detailed-documentation/supported-aws-services/sagemaker-service-limits), only specific EC2 instances are available in the workshop. Please your own account for ml.g5.8xlarge or above instances.
